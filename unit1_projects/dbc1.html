		<p id="intro">Hey, this is some <b>content</b> that I'm putting on the page. It doesn't really mean anything. It's just taking up some space so I can play around with it later. Even though I'm writing it in sublime, I'm sure it will look <i>pretty</i> different once it's up and running on the interwebs.</p>

		<p>Here's another paragraph. I don't really know what to say here, but the thing is telling me to <b>do</b> it, and to <b>use</b> <i>bold</i> and it<i>al</i>ics. All I know is that I hope I don't br<br/>eak anything.</p>

		<p class="link">And while I'm at it, I might as well throw out some <a href="http://www.google.com" title="You've probably been here before" target="_blank">links</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Devbootcamp" title="If you're actually reading this, you've probably been here too." target="_self">stuff</a>.</p>

		<h2>This thing is pretty cool:</h2>

			<li>HTML is pretty cool.</li>
			<li>It's not very difficult, either.</li>
			<li>But if you want to make your website look like it was mad ein any year after 1998, you probably need to know what you're doing.</li>
			<p>I'm just curious how this will turn out</p>
