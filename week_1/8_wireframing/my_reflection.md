*This exercise really reinforced the idea that UI should be all about how to minimize work on the part of the user. Leave out anything that can be left out, and put things where they are most likely to be lookd for. 

*I really enjoyed designing my blog. Even though I came up with a general idea of what I wanted it to look like before I started, it felt good to see it all come together on screen. It was also fun to change things on the fly, and adapting things when they didn't work as I envisioned them. I think I still have a ways to go to become an expert designer.

*The general concepts of design are pretty straightforward, but I think more small questions will come up as I do more designing. 

*I'm still struggling with some of the finer points of positioning with CSS. Sometimes elements will show up where I don't expect them to. So far, this has not related to anything important. I've been able to design around them. As I play with CSS and HTML more, I'd like to figure out how to work out some fo these kinks. 

* I learned how to wireframe :) 

* I'd like to explore more about wireframing software. Aside from that, I'm relatively confident in this challenge's learning competencies.

* It was kind of fun to pick apart different elements of websites. I normally wouldn't have much reason to look at them this closely.

* It was a bit tedious drawing out each wireframe. As I said above, I'd like to explore some wireframing software next time.
