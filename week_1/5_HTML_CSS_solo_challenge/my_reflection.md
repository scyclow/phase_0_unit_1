*My big struggle with this challenge was learning the intricacies of absolute and relative positioning. I delved into a lot of the articles listed on the GitHub page, and some of the articles that those articles linked to. In particular, the learn.shayhowe.com guide was very useful. This also provided a good explanation: http://alistapart.com/article/css-positioning-101

*It took me an inordinate amount of time to figure out how to center the contents of the web page. A lot of this was rooted in a misunderstanding of how positioning worked. It took me a few articles before it started to sink in. 

* I learned a lot about how CSS works and interacts with HTML. I also learned some tangential skills in using SublimeText. 

* I had no trouble with the specific competencies listed here. Positioning as it relates to borders, padding, and margins are pretty straight forward. 

*I enjoyed the initial phases, before I was focusing on centering the contents of the web page. I also enjoyed the end phase, after I gave up on centering the conents.

*Centering and positioning were tedious. I'm still not entirely sure I understand it 100%. I ultimately figured it out, but I'm not sure what I did to make it work.
