*I've been exposed to HTML before, so the overall concept makes sense to me. I don't have much exposure to JavaScript or Rails, so I'm not really sure how more dynamic languages play into all this. 

*HTML seems pretty simple and versatile. I can conceive of how to lay out most type fo web pages with it. However, it also seems very static. It is not powerful enough to create any interactivity without the help of other languages. HTML is also very boxy. I wonder if there is a way to make circles and round edges and such. 

*CSS is pretty cool. I looked at the source code for a few DBCers technical blogs, and was confused how they accomplished certain things. Then I read the section on CSS, and went "Aha!". It's a fairly straight forward concept overall, and I think I understand it...or at least get the logic ebhind it. I'm sure I'm still missing some of the finer points. 

*I've been consulting google a lot on this when referencing syntax. W3 schools comes up a lot. That seems like a good resource overall.
