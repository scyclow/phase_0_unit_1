## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

*To create a repo, you go to github.com/new, choose your profile as the owner, and pick a name for the repo. The repo defaults to public (anyone can see it), but you can also make it private. You also have the option of giving the repo a license. The license specifies what other users can and can't do with the files in the repo.

*Open source means that the code behind the program (the "source code") is available to the public, as well as the software itself. This means that other people are allowed to play around with the code, add/remove features, etc.

*It sounds like a good idea overall. Certain types of projects are definitely more suited to be released as open source. I wouldn't relseas classified government software, or proprietary business software, as open-source. But, for code intended to further the greater good in a non-profit capacity (and sometimes in a for-profit capacity), it seems pretty cool.

*Licenses ensure that the code is used in the way you intend it to be used. If you don't want it to be reproduced in any form, a strict license ensures that it won't be. If you want it to always be available a reproducible for all of eternity, an MIT license ensures that all freedoms inherently come with the code, except the freedom to exclude the MIT license.

*This is all fairly straightforward. I'm glad that these licenses exist, and that GitHub has streamlined the process for including licenses in repos. I have yet to memorize the intricacies of all the different licenses, but the MIT license should get the job done for now.

*The last open source link, "A Short Guide to Open Source", was the most comprehensive. I didn't feel the need to look up any additional resources after that.
