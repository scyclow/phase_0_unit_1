## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

*You can set up a repo by going to github.com/new, choosing an account to create the repo for, naming the repo, and flagging it as public/private (other people can or can't see it). You also have to option of adding a README, and a license. If the repo is public, the license stipulates what other people can and can't use the files for.

*Open source means that anyone can access and modify a certain set of files, and share these modified files with other people. 

*Open source sounds like a good idea in certain situations. For example, If I'm trying to create a non-profit project that will further the greater good, open source would be appropriate in many cases. If I'm releasing classified government software, or proprietary business software, open source would not be appropriate.

*Licenses are important because it helps ensure that files aren't used for unintentional purposes. For example, if I spend a lot of time creating some software, and would like to receive compensationf or my efforts, some licenses would help ensure that other people cannot profit from my work. Alternatively, if I publish some software that I want the whole world to use for free, and MIT license would help ensure that other people will keep distributing it with as much freedom as possible (except for the freedom to distribute without an MIT license).

*I definitely got a better sense of how git works after this challenge. However, I am still a little confused about the logistics on how multiple people can work on different versions fo the same file, and then combine their work into a single file.
