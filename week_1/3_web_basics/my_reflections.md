* I had a basic idea of how DNS services worked, but now I have a much better understanding. More specifically, I knew that clients navigated to websites based on their IP addresses, and acquired them by looking up the human-readable domain names in DNS registrars. However, I did not know that the query jumped around to several name servers.

I also learned a lot of other smaller, less important facts about how DNS services work. Pretty much the entire smashingmagazine article was new to me. I learned too many little factoids to count here.

*It might take a while for the domain name to work, because a lot of DNS services don't update their registrars continuously. Some might do it once a day. 

*At frist I was concerned, because it was not working. Then I read on the error page that it can take up to 10 minutes to display. When I checked back later I was releaved. 

*The git basics article that detailed how to record changes to repos was excellent. A lot of stuff clicked with me as I read that. I think I now have a much better understanding of how committing works.

*I stumbled upon this YouTube video from RuPy 13 a while ago, and gave it a rewatch. This covers a lot of the same topics, and gives a very clear explanation of how all the pieces fit together: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T-gCmP73Cw#t=1421
