Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?


To be honest, I didn't particularly enjoy the writting very much. I've written blog posts before about more interesting things. However, the research was helpful, in that it gave me a chance to reflect on good lay out. I really enjoyed building the blog. It was a lot of fun tweaking the lay out, which was inspired by one of the sites I mentioned in the post.
