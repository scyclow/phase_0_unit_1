# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.





* The DOM is a model for organizing web pages. HTML elements are all objects within the document, which are defined in a tree-like structure (ex. a list item is stored within an unordered list, which is stored in a div, which is stored within another another div, etc.). I understand that specific lexicon of the DOM exists so JS and Python and Ruby can interact with the HTML to make it more dynamic, but I'm a little unsure as to how this works. Hopefully it will become more clear as I start to use JavaScript.

* The wordpress site I visited (http://hideitinabook.com/) differed in several ways. First, it included (what I suspect are) event handlers. At first that several divs at the top of the document do not do anything. But, they are merely hidden. Once clicking on the menu button, a drop-down menu pops up. In addition, the wordpress document containts several <script> tags. 

* Dev tools is pretty useful. I still need to figure out what lal the bells and whistles do, but it's core functionality makes it pretty easy to pick apart existing web pages.

* No explicit 'aha' moments, but I think it's starting to come together in terms fo understanding how all the JavaScript/HTML/CSS pieces fit  with each other. 

* As usual, google, wikipedia, and atack overflow helped fill in some blanks.
