My Website url: <!-- Website URL here (remove comment) -->

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* Coloring and font-type are underrated. I think I learned a lot about how font types interact with cpacing, and how spacing interacts with colors.

* It was fun designing the site and doing the initial coding. Debugging it to make it look perfect took way too long. 
 
 * First I brainstormed what I wanted the site to accomplish. Then I tried to wireframe a page that accomplished those goals most efficiently. Then I coded it, and debugged it.

* I'd like to get the damn link hover pseudo selectors to work. I'd also like to play around with the spaceing and font of the main section. It looks a little cluttered right now.
 
* I didn't do much research outside of the posted readings for this one, unless it was on how to do somethign very specific.
