# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


* Standards are tricky. I read an article posted on the Google+ group that made a good argument laying out the pros and cons. On one hand, working from a reset file ensure that the web page does not load subject to unexpected default margins and padding. However, default margins and paddings are often set for a specific reason, so messing with them could make the page show up in a weird format. 

* I guess. It seems like a lot of the standards have been decided through trial and error. I'm snot entirely sure what the implications of these are yet. I haven't picked up much on this in the past. Going forward, I'll probably be a bit more perceptive of this, though.

*Yes, very much. It makes it much easier to read the file, and cuts out a lot of unnecessary code.

* Resets are useful because they ensure that the presentatino of the webpage is not messed up by the default settings of the webbrowser being used. 

*I've been using Chrome for a few years. before that, I uesd Mozilla. I don't switch between browsers very often, so I haven't noticed much of a difference in formatting. 

* This article on resetting was pretty interesting: http://sixrevisions.com/css/should-you-reset-your-css/
