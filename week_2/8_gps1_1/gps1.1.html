                <h2>Checking in</h2>
                <p>Good pairing sessions feel like a conversation. 
                Good communication during pairing is mainly through vocalizing your thoughts and thought process.
                Check in with your pair, ask them how their day is going and what state of mind they're in.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Pairing is super fun! It was really helpful. We both have a bit to learn about pairing, but it definitely helped streamline the process. Since you have a second brain, you are not looking stuff up as often. </br></br>
                Also, for some reason, we couldn't style the body tags. We had to create a "body" div, and style that.
