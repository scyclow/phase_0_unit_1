# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?


* Right now, I'm having some trouble balancing my day job with DBC work. Granted, my day job is in summer mode and my work load is not super intense. But, I'm still not able to devote as much time to DBC during the week as I'd like. The last two weeks, most of my work has been crammed into the weekend. By both Sunday nights, I've felt pressed for time. 
  * In addition, I often get sucked down a rabbit hole when it comes to debugging. I must have spent at least five hours this weekend debugging code...probably about as much time as I've spent learning code. I need to learn to take some breaks here instead of just endlessly hammering away at it.
* I guess I'll shoot to take more breaks when debugging. It can get really frustrating really quickly, and getting some space between me an the problem would probably help me out. 
* Meditation is a pretty good idea. I'm aware of all the proported benefits of meditation, but I don't practice it nearly enough. 
* Overall, I've been in the zone for a lot of phase 0. I don't want to needlessly interupt that for the sake of productivity tips. But, I would probably do better to not be "in the zone" as often when I'm frustrated and debugging. I should probably be more mindful of this, and take a walk or something when I need to. Hopefully, by doing this I can conserve some of my energy for when I need to actually be creative.
