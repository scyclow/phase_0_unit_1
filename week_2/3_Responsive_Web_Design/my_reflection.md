# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


* Responsive web design is when the style of a web page reacts to the format in which it is being used. This means that the page might show up differently on different devices with different dimensions. It also means that the page can shift as the window shifts.

* The prevalence of smart phones and tablets shifted overall expectations of websites. Because so many people are visiting websites on these devices, it makes sense that the web pages should not look like crap when viewed on said devices. So, if a lot of people are using iPhones, which have a width of 480px, websites should be designed to not look like crap with a width of 480px. I'm sure design will shift further as new platforms become more popular. Augmented and virtual reality should be interesting.

* Visually impaired people probably have custom settings for viewing web pages, possibly with high contrast and larger font. It's probably not a bad idea to shoot to make a website easy to read in general, but designers should not sacrifice overall visual appeal to please 100% of all people. Visually impaired people represent a minority of the potential user base (who can fix the problem on their end).

* I think it's a neat idea that web pages adapt to the size in which they are being viewed. There are some weird quirks that have to do with html borders and margins that are kind of stupid. As far as I can tell, there is no logic to certain things there.

* The Shay Howe guide (http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/responsive-web-design/) helped some of this stuff click with me.
